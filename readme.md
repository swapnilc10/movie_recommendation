In this repository I am going to write couple of recommendation system algorithms to start with.
Recommendation system are mainly of 3 types:
1- Content based filtering
2- Collaborative filtering
3- Hybrid Recommendation system

Content based filtering recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past, it works by analyzing the attributes of items and providing recommendations based on similarity.

Collaborative filtering recommends items based on the preference of similar users or items. It works by finding users or items that are similar to the current user or item and recommending items based on their preferences.

Hybrid Recommendation Systems,Combine multiple recommendation approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.For example, a hybrid system might combine content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to leverage the strengths of both.
